# 8-Bit CPU Brainfuck Interpreter
BUT FIT INP 2024 project.
Evaluation: 14/23.

This implementation doesn`t support tmp register and nested while loops,
but everything else should work properly.

The source code contains detailed comments and is easy to understand, I hope.

See task.pdf for the specifications.
